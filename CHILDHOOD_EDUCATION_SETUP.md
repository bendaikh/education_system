- French: "Éducation de l'Enfance", "Matières de l'Enfance", etc.

## Maintenance

### Adding New Subjects
1. Use the web interface to add subjects
2. Or create a new seeder for bulk data

### Modifying the System
- Models are in `app/Models/`
- Controllers are in `app/Http/Controllers/`
- Vue pages are in `resources/js/Pages/Admin/`
- Routes are in `routes/web.php`

### Database Changes
- Run `php artisan migrate` after any schema changes
- Use `php artisan db:seed --class=ChildhoodEducationSeeder` to add sample data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Routes not working**: Check if migrations ran successfully
2. **Missing data**: Run the seeder to add sample data
3. **Permission errors**: Ensure user has admin access
4. **Database errors**: Check foreign key relationships

### Debugging
- Check Laravel logs in `storage/logs/`
- Verify database tables exist
- Confirm route registration with `php artisan route:list`

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements could include:
- Student progress tracking
- Attendance management
- Parent communication portal
- Assessment and grading system
- Integration with existing student management
